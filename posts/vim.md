**What is Vim?**

To put it simply, Vim is a text editor. But it's not just like any other text editor. Vim is highly configurable and effiecient text editor. If you have a Unix system, chances are that you have Vim installed. For example, if you are running MacOs, open your terminal and type the following command: `vim test.txt`

**How to exit Vim**

So you've opened vim and now you can't exit. It seems so complicated I know. When I first started using it, I could not figure it out either. And just because I couldn't exit, I didn't understand why anyone even used this. But the truth is that vim is amazing once you get used to it. I actually used it to write the code of this entire blog.
